"Kindergarten Companion" is a smart monitoring app designed to keep parents connected with their child's daily life at kindergarten. With real-time input from supervisors, parents can see what and how much their child eats, how long and how well they sleep, whether any unexpected incidents occurred, and get an overview of their behavior—graded from A to F.

One unique feature of the app addresses a common challenge many parents face: the overwhelming number of drawings their little ones create. Instead of feeling guilty about throwing them away or struggling to store them all, supervisors can now scan and upload each artwork directly into the app. This way, every masterpiece is safely preserved in digital form, allowing parents to cherish their child's creativity without the clutter.

With Kindergarten Companion, you’ll stay informed, connected, and organized—every step of the way.
